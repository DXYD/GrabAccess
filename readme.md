# GrabAccess

**Bootkit / Windows Login Password Bypass Tool**

------

 [**English**](https://github.com/Push3AX/GrabAccess/blob/main/readme.md) | [中文](https://github.com/Push3AX/GrabAccess/blob/main/readme_cn.md) 

With physical access to the target device, GrabAccess can:

1. Bypass the Windows login password to execute commands with System privileges, reset Windows account passwords, etc.
2. Implant a specified program and add it to startup.
3. Survive operating system reinstallations or hard drive replacement, by modifying the UEFI firmware of motherboard (Bootkit)



## Quick Start

The basic function of GrabAccess is to bypass the Windows login password.

1. Prepare a USB drive formatted in either `FAT16` or `FAT32`.

2. Download [GrabAccess_Release.zip](https://github.com/Push3AX/GrabAccess/releases/download/Version1.1/GrabAccess_Release_1.1.0.zip) and extract it to the root directory of the USB drive.

3. Plug the USB drive into the target computer. Reboot and enter the BIOS menu upon startup. Select the USB drive as boot option (disable `Security Boot` if it's enabled).

4. A CMD window and an account management interface will appear upon Windows startup, granting the ability to execute commands with System privileges without the need for login credentials.

5. Press `ALT+F4` to close the CMD window, and Windows will return to the login screen.



## Automated Implantation

GrabAccess can automatically implant a specified program and add it to the startup items.

For this feature, you need to bundle GrabAccess with the program you wish to implanted:

1. Download [GrabAccess_Release.zip](https://github.com/Push3AX/GrabAccess/releases/download/Version1.1/GrabAccess_Release_1.1.0.zip) and extract it to the root directory of the USB drive.

2. Name the program  you wish to implanted as `payload.exe` and place it in the root directory of the USB drive.

3. Execute `build.bat` to bundle everything together.

4. Plug the USB drive into the target computer and boot from the USB drive (as previously described).

5. Once Windows boots up, the deployed application will be execute.

## Implementing Bootkit via Motherboard UEFI Firmware Modification

GrabAccess can be integrated into a computer's motherboard UEFI firmware, ensuring a hardware-level persistence (Bootkit).

Each time the Windows boots, GrabAccess re-implants the specified program. This process remains effective even after reinstallation of the operating system or replacement of the hard disk. Removal of this implant requires reflashing the motherboard's firmware or replacing the motherboard.

**Warning: The following procedure may damage your motherboard! Proceed only if you have sufficient knowledge of UEFI firmware. AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!**

The process involves four main steps:

1. Bundle GrabAccess with the specified program.
2. Extracting the motherboard's UEFI firmware.
3. Inserting GrabAccessDXE into the UEFI firmware.
4. Reflashing the modified firmware back onto the motherboard.

Steps 2 and 4 vary significantly across different motherboard models. While some can be flashed via software, others require a hardware programmer due to built-in verifications. 

Due to these variations, the specifics are not discussed here, it is advised to search online for the procedure relevant to your specific motherboard model.

To package GrabAccess with the intended program, follow the previously outlined steps: rename the program to `payload.exe`, place it in the GrabAccess root directory, and run `build.bat`. This results in a file named `native.exe`, which will be used in the subsequent steps.

After extracting the motherboard UEFI firmware, use [UEFITool](https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool) to open it. Press `Ctrl+F`, select `Text`, and search for `pcibus`. Double-click on the first result in the subsequent list.

Right-click on the `pcibus` entry and choose `Insert before`. Then select `GrabAccessDXE.ffs` from the `UEFI_FSS` folder in the downloaded [GrabAccess_Release.zip](https://github.com/Push3AX/GrabAccess/releases/download/Version1.1/GrabAccess_Release_1.1.0.zip).

After inserting `GrabAccessDXE`, right-click on it, choose `Insert before`, and add `native.ffs` from the `UEFI_FSS` folder. The list should appear as follows:

![8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Push3AX/GrabAccess/main/images/8.png)

Open `native.ffs` (identified by its GUID `2136252F-5F7C-486D-B89F-545EC42AD45C`). Right-click on the `Raw section`, select `Replace body`, and replace it with the `native.exe` file which is previously created.

Lastly, save the modified firmware by selecting `Save image file` from the File menu.

This firmware is now embedded with a Bootkit and ready to be flashed back onto the motherboard. If done correctly, `native.exe` will be written and executed with each boot of Windows.

If the process fails, consider these steps:

1. Turn off `Security Boot` and `CSM` in the UEFI settings, ensuring the OS boots in UEFI mode.
2. Insert `pcddxe.ffs` from the `UEFI_FSS` folder into the firmware (as previously described). Note that this module may conflict with others, potentially preventing booting. This step is advised only if using a programmer!



## Supported Operating Systems

GrabAccess only supports Windows operating systems under UEFI, and is currently only supports x64 systems.

Tested on Windows 10 (1803, 22H2) and Windows 11 (23H2), including using TPM, online accounts, and PIN codes. However, it does not support bypassing Security Boot.

## Windows Platform Binary Table

Unlike Kon-boot, which tampers with the Windows kernel, GrabAccess is based on a legitimate backdoor in Windows: WPBT (Windows Platform Binary Table).

Manufacturers typically use WPBT to integrate driver management and anti-theft software into their computers. Similar to a Bootkit virus, once a WPBT entry exists in the motherboard, the designated program will automatically installed on Windows system during boot-up, regardless of system reinstalls or hard drive changes.

WPBT was intended to be implemented by manufacturers into the UEFI firmware of the motherboard. However, attackers can exploit this mechanism by injecting a WPBT entry during the UEFI boot process, without needing to modify the motherboard firmware.



## Components of GrabAccess

GrabAccess consists of two components:

1. **UEFI Application**: In the source code as Stage1-UEFI, this is used to write WPBT entries into the ACPI table in the UEFI environment.
2. **Windows Native Application**: In the source code as Stage2-NativeNT, this is used to deploying the payload and setting up startup items.

## Functions of the Native Application

The application loaded by WPBT is not a standard Win32 program, but a Windows Native Application. It executes during the Windows Native NT phase, which occurs before user login. However, the APIs provided by Windows to Native NT phase are fewer than those available to Win32 programs.

In the source code, Stage2-NativeNT is tasked with writing out the final Payload (the specified program bundled by the user) to `C:\\Windows\\System32\\GrabAccess.exe`, and adding a startup item under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\GrabAccess`.

If there is no Payload at its end, it hijacks Logonui.exe through IFEO, displaying cmd.exe and netplwiz.exe during Windows login.
